## **THE GOAL:**

I set out to theorycraft a build that has the most retriggers possible for a given round. **IF YOU DO NOT WANT SPOILERS DO NOT CONTINUE READING** because this run requires a lot of spoiler-y charms and mechanics.

## **GENERAL STRATEGY:**

I'm gonna be using some Symbols/Variables throughout this build description so here's a helpful guide

***KEY***: 
 - **RT** = 1 Retrigger 
 - **N** = Number of spins
 - **S** = Number of symbols in current scoring pattern
 - **MD** = % chance of repetition modifier

We need to maximize charm slots, maximize spins per round, maximize the number 999s per round, maximize the amount of  applied obsessive traits, and minimize battery charge. With the retrigger-centric charms listed below, we have to hit the button (**N**/2) times (minus one depending on the previous round's final spin. If you ended on a 999 last round, -1 times) so that the final spin is not a 999 and hopefully lands a jackpot with a lot of Repetition Modifiers on symbols. 

## **THE BUILD:**

**Memory Card**: ***First Love***
We're using the First Love memory card as it lets us get +1 extra phone abilities in conjunction with Megaphone x Barathrum. With this we can reach 16 Charm Slots, get +6 Retriggers, and -6 Battery Cost, along with other benefits for scaling/building.

**The Symbol**: ***Cherries*** *(or lemons)*
This build uses cherries because I like the color, but also because the base probability of fruits is higher than all other symbols, and the synergy with clicker and fruit basket helps maximize retriggers

**The Pattern**: ***Jackpots and 999s***

We're trying to get 999 **N**-1 times, then land on a cherry Jackpot. A jackpot encompasses 10 patterns of applied retriggers. So our per pattern-applied retriggers happen 10x. If we get  a jackpot, then ***S*** = (15 * **MD**)

## **The Charms:**

***Retrigger Charms:***

Fruit Basket [ +1**RT** ]
Clicker [ (**S** * **MD**) * 1**RT** ] (**MD** = 0.15 or 15%)
Calculator [ +1**RT** ]  *( guaranteed 100% w/ golden horseshoe)*
Magical Tomato [ (**N**-1) * 1**RT** ]
Eternity [ (**N**-1) * 1**RT** ]
Personal Trainer [ (**S** * **MD**) * 1**RT**)  (**MD** = 0.25 or 25% if recently bought)
Poop Jar [ (**N** -1) * 2**RT** ]
Jimbo [ +1**RT** ] (If RNG god roll with +2 spins and +1 **RT** modifier)

***Utility Charms:***

Cell Phone (*Used to guarantee 999s for **N**-1 spins*)
Book of Shadows (*Used to add +6 spins during the round*)
Gold Horseshoe (*Used to guarantee calculator triggers*)
Cat Food (*Used to add +2 spins, increasing total triggers*)
Potato Battery (*Used to recharge phone, coin, horseshoe every spin after the 1st*)
Ancient Coin (*Used to add between +5 (min) to + (**N**- 1) Spins, increasing total triggers*)
Nuke (*Used to double phone, ancient coin, Poop jar and golden horseshoe occurrences*)
Megaphone (*Necessary for max charm slots, retrig buffs, and button charge discounts*)
Barathrum (*4x minimum required, you will need more. Stack with megaphone*)
House (*+2 Charm slots*)
Cardboard Box (*Stack with Abyssu to maximize charms slots*)
Abyssu (*1x minimum required for Cardboard Box*)
Jimbo (If RNG god roll with +2 spins and +1 **RT** modifier)

## **The Math:**
*I could be off here a little bit, its been a while since doing basic algebra. Lets assume the following:* 

 1. *We got lucky with the Ancient Coin not breaking during spins ( adds  **N-1** Spins)*
 2. *6 of our charms have the Obsessive trait (+6**RT**)*
 3. *We got all **N**-1 Spins of 999s with the Phone*
 4. *The final spin is a Cherry Jackpot (**S** = 15)*
 5. *We got the exact average **MD** * **S** Repetition Modifiers*


**Here's the math:**

**Total Spins per Round** (**N**) :  [***33 Spins***]

*7 Spins (base) + 2 Spins (Jimbo) + 2 Spins (Cat Food) + 6 Spins (Book of Shadows) =* *17 Spins* 

*(17 Spins * 2) - 1 (Ancient Coin unbroken) =* ***33 Spins***

**N = 33 Spins**

**Percent Chance of repetition modifier (MD)**: ***40% (or 6 Symbols with Repetition)*** :

15% (Clicker) + 25% (Personal Trainer with no rounds used) = **40%**

15 (Symbols) * 0.4 (40%) = **6 Symbols**



**Total Charm Retriggers**: 

*Basic +1 Charms :*
Fruit Basket + Jimbo + Calculator = 

[ ***+3RT*** ]

*Repetition Modifier Charms:*
Personal Trainer + Clicker =  
(**S** * **MD**) * 1**RT**)  = 
(**15** * **.40**) * 1**RT**)  = 
( **6** * 1**RT** )  = 

[ ***+6RT*** ]

*( ( **N** - 1 ) * 1**RT** ) Charms:*
Eternity ( 1**RT** ) + Poop Jar ( 2**RT** with Button ) + Magical Tomato ( 1**RT** ) = 
( 3 * ( **N** - 1 ) * 4**RT** ) =
( 3 ( **33** - 1 ) * 4**RT** )  = 
( 98 * 4**RT** ) = 

[ ***+392RT*** ]




## **The Total:**
The total retriggers in the final spin of the round are calculated like so:

(  ***3RT***  +  ***6RT***  + ***392RT*** ) * 10 + **6RT** =

**TOTAL** :  [***4016 RETRIGGERS IN A SINGLE SPIN***]


Anyway, let me know if you're attempting these runs. I'mma be chasing this for a bit.
